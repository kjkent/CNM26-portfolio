            <h2>Why programming?</h2>
            <p>I initially started programming as an antidote to lockdown boredom, taking Harvard University's online CS50x course.
            I quickly realised that development offers a career that's rewarding, intellectually stimulating, and opens up vast opportunities. I appreciated coding's problem-solving challenges, and developed a newfound appreciation for the technological infrastructure that underpins our daily lives.
            After learning about Code Nation and contacting one of its admissions advisers, I enrolled into their Master 26 cohort to make the first steps towards a career in this space.

            <h2>The course so far</h2>
            <p>One week into the course, I had covered the basic fundamentals of javascript and how to manipulate data.
            My week one targets included understanding and working with dot notation, variables, operators, if/else/switch statements, arrays, loops, functions, and ojects.
            I completed Code Nation's cricket kata which required the understanding and use of multiple javascript fundamentals, and created small programs to illustrate their use.
